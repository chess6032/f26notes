# TS Notes

Notes on TS syntax 'n shih.

## tsconfig.json

`tsconfig.json` configures `tsc`, the TS &rarr; JS transpiler.

By default, `tsc` compiles all `.ts` files in the project. Good to know.

Here's some important compiler options (`compilerOptions` in `tsconfig.json`):

- `target`: specifies which version of JS code to generate.
- `module`: specifies which module system thould be used in the generate JS code.
- `ourDir`: specifies directory where generated JS files are placed.
- `sourceMap`: specifies whether source map files will be generated (for debugging).
  - Source map files map line numbers in the JS code back to the corresponding line numbers in the original TS code. This is necessary for debuggers to properly implement breakpoints.
- `files` can be used to explicitly list files & directories that should be compiled.

## Type declaration files (`.d.ts`)

`.d.ts` files provide type information for JS libraries they can be called from TS code (which requires types).

They also enable IDEs to provide auto-complete functionality.

`tsc` can generate `.d.ts` files for your TS code when your transpile it. That way otheres can use your JS code instead of needing your TS source files.

## Modules (`import`/`export`)

Any file containing a top-level `import` or `export` statement is considered a "module". Any file lacking this is a "script" whose contents are available in the global scope.

- Modules are executed w/in their own scope&mdash;NOT the global scope.
  - Vars, funcs, classes, etc. declared in a module are not visible elsewhere unless the module `export`s it.
  - Modules cannot see other modules' exported shih unless they `import` it.

### Export Syntax

There are two ways to `export` shih:

1. Add **`export` keyword** to declaration.

```ts
export function getInputValue(): void {}
export class Player {}
export interface Person {}
```

2. Add **`export` statement** to module.

```ts
function getInputValue(): void {}
class Player {}
interface Person {}

export { getInputValue as getUserInput, Player, Person };
```

#### `export default`

You can mark a single export as the module's "main" export with `export default`. Then, when you import it from another module, you don't need to enclose its name in curly braces.

```ts
// circles.ts
export const PI = 3.14159;

export default circleArea(radius: number): number {
  return PI * radius * radius;
}
```

```ts
import circleArea, { PI } from "./circles";
      // ^ circleArea is circles.ts's default export, so it doesn't need braces.
                  // ^ Everything else imported from circles.ts must be enclosed in braces.

console.log(circleArea(2), PI);
```

Any module can only have ONE (1) `export default`.

### Import syntax

To import `item` from `module.ts`, you would do this:

```ts
import { item } from "path/to/module";
```

If you wanted to give `item` an alias, you would add `as`:

```ts
import { item as alias } from "path/to/module";
```

You can also wildcard your imports to import all exported items from a module:

```ts
import * as people from "./person";
people.getUserInput();
```

## Classes

- TS supports `public`, `protected`, `private`, and `readonly` (const) members.
  - Members are **public by default**.
- TS supports object literals, like JS. 
  - These look like <code>{<i>name</i>: <i>val</i>, &hellip;}</code>
- `extends` is the keyword for inheritance.
  - <code>class <i>Sub</i> extends <i>Super</i></code>
- TS supports abstract classes (<code>abstract class <i>Class</i></code>).
- TS supports interfaces (<code>interface <i>Interface</i></code>).
  - Interfaces can inherit from shih, too.
- Classes can only inherit from one superclass, but they can extend multiple interfaces.
- Instantiate a class w/ `new`.
  - <code><i>obj</i> = new <i>Class</i>(&hellip;);</code>
- "Property" instead of "member" to refer to a class's variables, methods, etc.
  - Sometimes "field", it appears? (Especially when referring to a non-method member...?)

### Parameter properties (constructors)

TS has a special syntax for turning a constructor parameter into a class property with the same name/type (and value). The closest analogue I can think of is initializer lists in C++.

It looks like this:

```ts
class Params {
  constructor(
    public readonly x: number,
    protected y: number,
    private z: number
  ) { /* No body necessary */ }
}
```

### Accessors (getters/setters)

If you define a function <code>public get <i>member</i>()</code> in a class *`Class`*, then accessing <code><i>Class</i>.<i>member</i></code> (no parenthesis) will call that getter function. This is called a ***`get` accessor***.

You can make a setter by replacing `get` with `set` and giving it params. This is called a ***`set` accessor***. 

> [!NOTE]
> Both `get` and `set` are referred to in TS's documentation as "accessors", but some literature refers only to `get` as an "accessor" and `set` as a "mutator".

To handle assignments of different types, you can make its param type a union (and use `typeof` in the function body). However, you can NOT overload the `set` accessor.

## Unions & Intersections (typing)

- Intersection: `T1 & T2`.
  - An obj typed as `T1 & T2` contains ALL members of `T1` AND `T2`.
- Union: `T1 | T2`.
  - An obj typed as `T1 | T2` may be a `T1`, a `T2`, or both (union).
    - i.e., it might contain all of `T1`'s members, all of `T2`'s members, or all of both.

## Structural typing (class/function inter-compatibility)

TS uses a structural typing system. This means that TS compares objects by their structure, not their name. (Apparently this is true for all types? Idk.) **Two classes are compatible if they share the same "shape"**.

When we say "same shape", we mean **the same property names (w/ the same types)**. When comparing classes, TS looks at each class's instance members&mdash;essentially, what it would look like as an interface.

In other words, **"If it walks and talks like a duck, it's a duck."** (In fact, structural typing is sometimes called "duck typing".)

When we say "compatibile," we mean that you can substitute one for the other. e.g., if a function's parameter is typed as a class `C1` and `C1` is compatible with a class `C2`, you can pass a `C2` object into that function.

TS uses structural typing to compare *functions* as well as objects. Functions with the same parameter types (w/ the same order) and the same return type are compatible, even if they have different names or param names.

> [!NOTE]
> The opposite of a structural typing system is a nominal type system, in which two types are compatible only if they're explicitly declared to be related (e.g., one class extends another or implements the same named interface). In other words, objects are compatible if they share an identity, not a shape. 
> 
> Java and C# are examples of languages that use nominal typing system.

Here's some important nuances:

* Excess properties are (usually(?)) fine. If a class `C1` the same members/types as a class `C2` and *then some of its own*, `C1` is still compatible with `C2`.
* Private/protected properties are always tied to the specific class body that declared them. Two classes that write the same name & type of a private member are not compatible.
  * Note that this does not apply to object literals, since object literals can't have private properties in the first place.


## `+` operator is SUS

The `+` has some weird behavior.

### `+` for objects

**When you add two objects, JS coerces them to primitives** and evaluates that sum. This coercion (conversion?) takes two steps:

1. Call the object's `valueOf()` function. If `valueOf()` returns a primitive, then use that.
2. If `valueOf()` does not return a primitive, call the object's `toString()` function, and use that.

> [!NOTE]
> Strings are primitives in JS/TS.

This is why adding arrays is super sus:

<pre><code>$ node
> <i>arr1 = ['a', 'b', 'c'];</i>
> <i>arr2 = ['d', 'e', 'f'];</i>
> <i>arr1 + arr2;</i>
'a,b,cd,e,f'
</code></pre>


### `+` for primitives

When adding two primitives, **if one of the primitives is a string, the result will ALWAYS be a string.** Otherwise, it **coerces the primitives to numbers**.

- Adding a number to a string prepends/appends the number to the string. e.g., `1 + 'rizz'` == `'1rizz'`.
- `null` when coerced to a number becomes `0`.
- `undefined` when coerced to a number becomes `NaN`.
- `NaN` is a number.

### The other arithmetic operators are NOT sus (`-`/`*`/`/`)

`+` is the ONLY arithmetic operator that works this way. All the other arithmetic operators (`-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, etc.) **try to coerce operands to numbers (if it isn't already). If it is unable to, the result is always `NaN`.**

This is why `'25' + 1` is `'251'` but `'25' - 1` is `24`. In the case of the latter, `'25'` is converted to `25` (a number), and then `1` is subtracted from it.

For objects, JS uses `valueOf()` and checks if its return type is a number. If it is, it uses that. Otherwise, the result of the expression will be `NaN`.

### Examples

<pre><code>$ node
> <i>'hey' + 1</i>
'hey1'
> <i>'hey' - 1</i>
NaN
> <i>'3' + 2</i>
'32'
> <i>'3' * 2</i>
6
> <i>1 + NaN</i>
NaN
> <i>1 + undefined</i>
NaN
> <i>1 + null</i>
1
> <i>let obj = { valueOf: () => 69 }</i>
> <i>obj / 3</i>
23
> <i>obj == 69;</i>
true
</code></pre>

> [!TIP]
> If you're ever curious, you can use JS's built-in `String()` and `Number()` functions to see how an object or primitive is converted/coerced to a string or number, respectively.


## Type aliases

Type aliases look like this:

```ts
type TypeName = /* ... */
```

### Type alias Examples

Here's some examples:

```ts
type Cat = {
    name: string,
    purrs: boolean
};

type Dog = {
    name: string,
    barks: boolean,
    wags: boolean
};

type CatOrDogOrBoth = Cat | Dog;

type CatAndDog = Cat & Dog;
```

## Interfaces vs. type aliases

With unions, you can (kind of) "extend" type aliases the way you can w/ interfaces.

```ts
type Base = {
  prop1: string
}

type Derived = Base & {
  prop2: number
}
```

But interfaces have better type checking with extensions. In general, **if `Derived` must be usable wherever `Base` is, use interfaces**.

```ts
interface A {
  good(x: number): string
  bad(x: number): string
}

interface B extends A {
  good(x: string | number): string
  bad(x: string): string  // Error TS2430: Interface 'B'
}                         // incorrectly extends
                          // interface 'A'. Type 'number' is 
                          // not assignable to type 'string'.
```

```ts
// with type aliases
type A = {
  good(x: number): string
  bad(x: number): string
}

type B = A & {
  good(x: string | number): string
  bad(x: string): string
}               // No Error! But bad() can’t be 
                // called because no parameter is 
                // both string and number.
                // B must be useable wherever A 
                // is expected.
```

## Interface merging

You can do this&mdash;

```ts
// Face has one field, a string called "prop1".
interface Face {
  prop1: string
}

// Face has two fields, "prop1" and "prop2".
interface Face {
  prop2: number
}
```

&mdash;and it's the same as this:

```ts
interface Face {
  prop1: string,
  prop2: number
}
```

This is called "interface merging". I'm not really sure where you'd want to use it though.

## `let` vs `var`

* `let` is scoped to its **code block**. 
* `var` is scoped to its **function**.

```ts
if (true) {
  let x = "let";
  var y = "var";
}

console.log(y); // OK
console.log(x); // Uncaught ReferenceError: x is not defined
```

A `let`-defined variable can overshadow a `var`-defined one.

```ts
var x = "var";
if (true) {
  let x = "let";
  console.log(x); // let
}
console.log(x); // var
```

## Functions

- JS/TS supports default parameters (same as C++ or Python).
  - (Added in ES6.)

### Function declarations vs. function expressions

Here is a function declaration:

```ts
function foo() {
  // do stuff...
  return 67;
}
```

Here is a function expression:

```ts
const foo = function() {
  // do stuff...
  return 67;
}
```

Both of those functions would do the same thing. I.e., if you have two functions with the same params, return, and body, they'll do the same thing even if one is created via a declaration and the other is created via an expression.

However, they differ in that **function *declarations* are *hoisted*, while function *expressions* are not.** "Hoisted" means that the function is moved up to the top of the file. This allows you to invoke a function before you declared it.

```ts
hey(); // hey

function hey() {
  console.log("hey");
}
```

```ts
hey(); // ReferenceError: hey is not defined

hey = function() {
  console.log("hey");
};
```

### Arrow functions

This function&mdash;

```ts
function foo(bar) {
  return bar + 1;
}
```

&mdash;looks like this as an arrow function:

```ts
const foo = bar => bar + 1;
```

You can add `()` if your want more than one param&mdash;or if you want none:

```ts
const foo = () => console.log("hey");
```

And you can add `{}` if you want more than one statement in the body. However, then you have to include a `return` statement if you want to return anything.

```ts
const foo = (bar1, bar2) => {
  console.log("wow!");
  return `${bar1}: ${bar2}`;
};
```

#### Returning an object

If you want a one-line arrow function to return an object, encase the object in parenthesis. Otherwise the interpreter will think you're trying to define the function's body.

```ts
const foo = () => ( {skibidi: 'rizz', gyatt: 'ohio'} );
```

#### Scope

**Arrow functions preserve the scope (`this`) in which they were created.** This is especially helpful when passing functions into callbacks that might otherwise change what `this` references.

For example:

```ts
const tahoe = {
  mountains: ["Freel", "Rose", "Tallac", "Rubicon", "Silver"],
  print: (delay = 1000) => {
    setTimeout(() => { // <--- this MUST be an arrow function, or else this.mountains will be undefined.
      console.log(this.mountains.join(", "));
    }, delay);
  }
};
```

## Destructuring

Destructuring is the act of extracting individual items from an object or array.

### Destructuring objects

Writing <code>let { <i>prop1</i>, <i>prop2</i>, &hellip; } = <i>obj</i>;</code> will assign `prop1` to `obj.prop1`, `prop2` to `obj.prop2`, etc.

**Object destructuring *copies* the objects data**. If you modify the destructed variables you created, it won't affect the object's data.

```ts
const sandwich = {
  bread: "white",
  meat: "turkey",
  cheese: "provolone",
  toppings: ["lettuce", "tomato", "mayo"]
};

let { bread, meat } = sandwich;

console.log(`${bread}, ${meat}`); // white, turkey 

bread = "wheat";
meat = "ham";

console.log(`${bread}, ${meat}`); // wheat, ham
console.log(`${sandwich.bread}, ${sandwich.meat}`); // white, turkey
```

#### Destructuring object-typed function parameters

You can use object destructuring syntax inside of function parameters, too. Consider a function that takes an object and accesses its members:

```ts
const praise = person => {
  console.log(`${person.firstname} has a big, juicy gyatt.`)
}

const coolPerson = {
  firstname: "Caleb",
  lastname: "Hessing"
};

praise(coolPerson); // Caleb has a big, juicy gyatt.
```

Instead of digging into the object with `.`, you can destructure the values you need out of it:

```ts
const praise ({ firstname }) => {
  console.log(`${firstname} has a big, juicy gyatt`);
}

const coolPerson = {
  firstname: "Caleb",
  lastname: "Hessing"
};

praise(coolPerson); // Caleb has a big, juicy gyatt.
```

This can be especially nice if you want to access a property from an object nested within the one you expect to be passed into the function. E.g., `const praiseSpouse = ({ spouse: { firstname }}) => { /* ... */ };`.

### Destructuring Arrays

Writing <code>[<i>var1</i>, <i>var2</i>, &hellip;] = <i>array</i>;</code> will assign `var1` to `array[0]`, `var2` to `array[1]`, etc.

Like object destructuring, this copy is by *value*, NOT reference. Modifying the variables you created in the destructuring will not modify the original array you copied from.

You don't have to copy all elements over (i.e., for an array w/ $n$ elements, you do NOT can destructure $k < n$ elements from it). Additionally, you can skip over elements by leaving empty space between commas.

```ts
const animals = ["horse", "mouse", "cat", "dog"];

const [firstAnimal, secondAnimal] = animals;
console.log(firstAnimal); // horse
console.log(secondAnimal); // mouse

const [, , thirdAnimal] = animals;
console.log(thirdAnimal); // cat
```

> [!TIP]
> For more advanced array destructuring, use the spread operator (see below).

## Restructuring (object literal enhancement)

Object literal enhancement is the opposite of destructuring.

```ts
const name = "Ryan Gosling";
const rating = 10;
const introduce = function {
  console.log(`Hey, this is ${name}, a certified ${rating}/10!`);
};

const ryanG = { name, rating, introduce };

console.log(ryanG.name); // Ryan Gosling
console.log(ryanG.rating); // 10
ryanG.introduce(); // Hey, this is Ryan Gosling, a certified 10/10!
```

Obj literal enhancement is copy-by-value. In the above example, modifications to `name`, `rating`, or `introduce()` would not affect `ryanG`.

## Spread operator (`...`)

**The spread operator unpacks an array** (or object): <code>...<i>arrOrObj</i></code>.

### `...` for copying an array

You can use `[...arr]` to quickly copy an array `arr`. This is useful because simple assignment is by reference. 

```ts
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
let [...arrCopy] = arr;

arrCopy[0] = 'skibidi';
console.log(arrCopy); // ['skibidi', 2, 3]
console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3]
```

It's also useful when you want to use an array function that normally would mutate the array.

```ts
const runners = ['Sonic', 'Mario', 'Koopa the Quick'];
const [last] = [...peaks].reverse();
                      // ^ Array.reverse() is a mutator function, 
                      // but because [...peaks] creates a copy,
                      // the original peaks array is left unmodified.

console.log(last); // Koopa the Quick
console.log(runners.join(', ')); // Sonic, Mario, Koopa the Quick
```

### `...` for array concatenation

```ts
let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
let arr2 = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

let joined = [...arr1, ...arr2];
console.log(joined); // [1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c']
```

^ Doing this copies by value, not by reference. So, in that example, modifications to `arr1` or `arr2` would not affect `joined`.

### `...` with array destructuring

You can use `...` to copy remaining values in an array. <code>[<i>var1</i>, <i>var2</i>, &hellip;, <i>varn</i>, ...<i>varRest</i>] = <i>arr</i></code> will copy the $n+1$th element and on from `arr` into `varRest`.

```ts
const runners = ['Sonic', 'Mario', 'Koopa the Quick'];
const [first, ...others] = runners;

console.log(first); // Sonic
console.log(others.join(', ')); // Mario, Koopa the Quick.
```

### `...` for parameters ("rest" parameters)

For a function parameter <code>...<i>param</i></code>, `param` will appear to the function to be an array, while the caller will just put in a list of inputs. I.e., it allows a function to accept a variable number of positional arguments; JS will pack all extra positional arguments into a single array.

This is only allowed for a function's LAST parameter.

(It's kind of analogous to Python's `*args`)

```ts
function announce(msg, ...people) {
  people.forEach((person) => {
    console.log(`${msg}: ${person}`);
  });
}

announce("NOW ENTERING", "Caleb", "Lotus", "Eve");
// NOW ENTERING: Caleb
// NOW ENTERING: Lotus
// NOW ENTERING: Eve
```

### `...` for objects

You can use `...` to inject members of one object into another.

```ts
const weekdays = {
  mon: 0,
  tue: 1,
  wed: 2,
  thu: 3,
  fri: 4
};

const sat = 5;
const sun = 6;

const daysOfTheWeek = {
  ...weekdays,
  sat,
  sun
};

console.log(daysOfTheWeek.mon); // 0
console.log(daysOfTheWeek.fri); // 4
console.log(daysOfTheWeek.sat); // 5
console.log(daysOfTheWeek.sun); // 6
```

## Types/Interfaces: Call Signatures

When defining an object type (or an interface), you can include *call signatures*. These are functions signatures with no name, and they are invoked by calling the instance of the type (or interface) itself.

For example:

```ts
interface ShoutNumber {
    (n: number): void
};

let shouter: ShoutNumber = (n: number) => { console.log(`YOUR NUMBER IS ${n}`); }
shouter(67);
```


## Generics in TypeScript

Generics are defined by adding `<T>` after a function's/class's/whatever's name (where `T` would then be the placeholder type). For arrow functions, you put the angle brackets right before the parenthesized list of parameters.

```ts
// generics in type script

class GenericClass<T> { /* ... */ }

interface GenericInterface<T> { /* ... */ };

type GenericAlias<T> = { /* ... */ };

function genericFunction<T>(…) { /* ... */}

const genericArrowFunc = <T>(…) => { /* ... */ };
```

Separate multiple types with commas. e.g., `<T, U, V>`.

> [!WARNING]
> If you're defining a generic arrow function in a `.tsx` file, you have to ***include a comma** or else it will be interpreted as JSX*.
>
> ```ts
> const bad  = <T>(…) => … ;  // <T> is interpreted as a JSX tag. Throws error.
> const good = <T,>(…) => … ; // <T,> is correctly interpreted as a generic.
> ```

### Inferred bindings on generic function calls

TypeScript can *infer* the type argument for function calls.

```ts
// Plain function declaration
function first<T>(arr: T[]): T { return arr[0]; }
first([1, 2, 3]);        // T inferred as number

// Arrow function
const wrap = <T,>(x: T) => ({ value: x });
wrap('hi');              // T inferred as string

// Generic class constructor
class Box<T> { constructor(public item: T) {} }
new Box(42);             // Box<number>, T inferred from the argument

// Built-in library methods
[1, 2, 3].map(n => String(n));   // map<U> infers U as string
Promise.resolve(true);           // Promise<boolean>
new Map([['a', 1]]);             // Map<string, number>
```

This only works for *function calls*. If you reference a *type* that uses a generic, inference doesn't apply. (e.g., when declaring a variable of type `Box<T>`, you have to supply a type for `T`.)

Even in cases where TypeScript *can* infer generic types, you are still allowed to explicitly define a type.

### Scoping

Consider TypeScript's signature for its `Array` class's `filter()` and `map()` functions:

```ts
interface Array<T> {
  filter(
    callbackfn: (value: T, index: number, array: T[]) => any,
    thisArg?: any
  ): T[]
  map<U>(
    callbackfn: (value: T, index: number, array: T[]) => U,
    thisArg?: any
  ): U[]
}
```

Note here that `T` applies to the entire `Array` class, but `U` is scoped to *just* the `map()` function.

#### Typings are inferred by the type parameter, not type argument

(Recall: "*parameter*" refers to the *definition* of some input, while "*argument*" refers to the *value passed in* for that input.)

TypeScript uses the *definition* of the generic for type inference. This can cause a problem&mdash;especially if you're using library function calls&mdash;where TypeScript isn't specific enough with its type inferencing.

For example, this code--

```ts
let promise = new Promise(resolve => 
  resolve(45)
);
promise.then(result => // Inferred as {}
  result * 4 // ERROR TS2362 (result is not compatible with * operator)
)
```

--is fixed by explicitly providing a type:

```ts
let promise = new Promise<number>(resolve => 
  resolve(45)
);
promise.then(result => // Inferred as number
  result * 4
)
```

### Default type arguments

You can give a generic a default type the same way you give a parameter a default value: `someName<T = defaultType>`

### Bounded polymorphism

Sometimes, "this thing of some type `T`" isn't enough, and you need "this thing is of some type `U` that is *at least `U`*." 

You would do this by defining the type parameter as `<U extends T>`. Such a case is called adding an *upper bound*. You could add further bounding with type intersections (e.g., `<V extends T & U>`).

This is especially crucial when you want to be able to safely invoke a method or reference a property on an object of a generic type. Here's an example of just that in a bounded BST node type:

```ts
type BSTNode = {
  value: string
}

type LeafNode = BSTNode & {
  isLeaf: true
}

type InnerNode = BSTNode & {
  children: [TreeNode] | [TreeNode, TreeNode]
}

function mapNode<T extends TreeNode>( // <--- UPPER BOUND
  node: T, f: (value: string) => string
): T {
  return {
    ...node,
    value: f(node.value);
  }
}
```
